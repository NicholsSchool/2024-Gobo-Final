        NOTES ...
DO NOT RESET IMU AT THE START OF TELEOP FOR COMPETITION MATCHES, REMOVE THAT LINE FROM DRIVETRAIN

Decide whether we are using Wrist Fourbar or manual power

Decide whether to to Drive Motor Tuning

Will assuming the wrist offset at the start of teleop cause problems?

Be mindful with loop times with each new functionality (especially IMU and Vision)
Current Estimate: empty = 1-2 millis, no arm 10-20 millis, drivetrain 30-40 millis

Have James put TF file on the robot

Consider tighten front odometry, loosen all wheels SLIGHTLY.

If ever necessary, use the NavX over the internal IMU
