DO NOT RESET IMU AT THE START OF TELEOP FOR COMPETITION MATCHES, REMOVE LINE FROM DRIVETRAIN

We REALLY need a new wrist motor and hand, they SUCK

Will assuming the wrist offset at the start of teleop cause problems?

Be mindful with loop times with each new functionality (especially IMU and Vision)
Current Estimate: empty = 1-2 millis, no vision/imu 10-30 millis

Have James put TF file on the robot

Consider tighten front odometry, loosen all wheels. Consider re-drilling if problems occur

If ever necessary, use the NavX over the internal IMU
