        NOTES ...
DO NOT RESET IMU AT THE START OF TELEOP FOR COMPETITION MATCHES, REMOVE THAT LINE FROM DRIVETRAIN

Will assuming the wrist offset at the start of teleop cause problems?

Be mindful with loop times with each new functionality (especially IMU and Vision)
Current Estimate: empty = 1-2 millis, arm 10-20 millis, drivetrain 30-40 millis

        TODOS...
MAKE AN EXACT ORDER AND PROCEDURE FOR ALL TUNING

DEBUG EVERYTHING

Do Vision

Test and Tune Drivetrain, Tighten front odometry, loosen all dead wheels SLIGHTLY.

Test and Tune Arm, Decide whether we are using Wrist Fourbar or manual power

Have James put TF file on the robot

Make Autos

If ever necessary, use the NavX over the internal IMU
