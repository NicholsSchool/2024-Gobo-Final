        NOTES ...
Optimize loop times as much as possible
AprilTagGameDatabase.java contains the field positions of all tags

        Large TODOS:
Make An Exact Order and Procedure for All Tuning
Test and Tune Vision
Test and Tune Drivetrain
Test and Tune Arm
Have James put TF file on the robot
Make Autos

        Small TODOS:
CoordinateMotionProfile - Tune Default Speed
Robot - add subsystems and controls
Arm - tune arm go to position
Arm - tune arm governor
Arm - tune wrist governor
Drivetrain - test RUN_USING_ENCODER effect on loop time
Drivetrain - tune the drive motors ff OR remove drive encoders
Drivetrain - debug the driving profile change
Drivetrain - debug the spline change
Drivetrain - tune spline p
Drivetrain - tune spline error
Drivetrain - optimize spline waypoints
Drivetrain - tune the driving profile speed
Drivetrain - tune the odometry correction
Vision - debug the logic
Vision - decide if small april tags are worth it
ArmTeleop - full check of all arm functionalities
ControllerTeleop - color, rotate, and scale the grid. Center the square
DrivetrainTeleop - full check of all drivetrain functionalities
Vision - full check of all vision functionalities
