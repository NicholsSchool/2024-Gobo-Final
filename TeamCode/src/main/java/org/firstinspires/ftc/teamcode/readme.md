GOALS/TODOS ...

Will assuming the wrist offset at the start of teleop cause problems?

Be mindful with loop times with each new functionality (especially IMU and Vision)
Current Estimate: empty = 1-2 millis, simple controls = 4-10 millis

Get the NavX working. Decide whether to average it with the internal IMU

Get Spline Working

Use the lights to communicate instead of telemetry

Tune and retune all feedback loops

Tune camera exposure

Fully test Localization math, add smoothing and weighted average based on Range
Decide if Small April Tags are worth it (hopefully will be)

Have James put TF file on the robot

LinearOpMode autos using TF detection and spline controls
