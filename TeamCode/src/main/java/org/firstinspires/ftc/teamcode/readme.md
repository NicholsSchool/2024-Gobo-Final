GOALS/TODOS/NOTES ...

We REALLY need a new wrist motor and hand, they SUCK

Will assuming the wrist offset at the start of teleop cause problems?

Be mindful with loop times with each new functionality (especially IMU and Vision)
Current Estimate: empty = 1-2 millis, no vision/imu 10-30 millis

Have James put TF file on the robot

Consider re-drilling odometry (and/or tightening front one) if it shows to be a problem

Verified:
Both profiles work as intended (both need tuning for all cases)
Controller works as intended
IMU works as intended
Hand works as intended
Lights work as intended (need to switch out right side)

Testing Order:
Arm
Drivetrain
Vision
