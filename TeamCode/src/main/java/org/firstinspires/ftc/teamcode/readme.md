        NOTES ...
AprilTagGameDatabase.java contains the field positions of all tags
Autos should end with robot facing forward or else there will be a delay until an April Tag is seen

        Large TODOS:
Full Code Physical Testing
Drive Practice: Full Code Tuning and Verify that being Red doesn't mess anything up
Have James put TF file on the robot
Make Autos

For next comp:
Is is possible to link methods to buttons in controller class using lambda functions?
Modify structure so that there is no isBlueAlliance check in the loops

        Small TODOS:
Robot - edit all arm set positions: floor, scoring, plane launching, climbing
Robot - remove telemetry method after checking final loop time
Drivetrain - tune the drive motors ff OR remove drive encoders
Drivetrain - tune spline p
Drivetrain - tune spline error
Drivetrain - edit all spline waypoints
Drivetrain - tune the driving profile speed
Drivetrain - tune the odometry correction
Vision - decide if small april tags are worth it
ControllerTeleop - color, rotate, and scale the grid. Center the square
ControllerTeleop - add a test for both profiles here
DrivetrainTeleop - test the RUN_USING_ENCODER effect on loop time
